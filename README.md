# Treesuregg Hunt
A small app that I made for my niece. This way she can egg hunt but with some tech to made it even more funny!


## What is the ideia behind it?
So, my niece really like all this "treasure hunt" stuff, but she also likes to play games in her phone. So I thought "Why not build something with both of these premises?"

This is how I came with the ideia of a simple app for the Egg Hunt stuff

## How it works?
It's simple. 
- First, we created 10 codes, 10 riddles and a map divided in 10 parts.
- Each riddle awnser points her to a part of our house.
- When she get in this part of the house, shw will find a code.
- She then, will be required to input this code into the app.
- When she inputs the code, then she will reveal a part of the map and a new riddle.
- The last code will reveal the X in the map, where her gift will be waiting
